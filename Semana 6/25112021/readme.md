In todays class we learn how to work in Databricks. Databriks is tool that **allows you to code in the same notebook differents language, like python and SQL**

We learn the following things:
- Export data from python or SQL to csv
- Create a cluster
- Create a new notebook
- Import data source
- Create tables

## Import Data as a csv

In the image above we import a new data source in Databricks, with that on the workspace, the platform allows you to work with the data.

## Import data as a url
In the following image, instead of importing the data set as a txt, we import a pre prepared notebook from a url and run each cell to see it works correctly.

I found this new tool very interesting as it allows you to combine SQL and python in the same notebook, which other platforms doesn't. Find it really usefull.

Thank you for reading.
